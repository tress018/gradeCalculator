Grade Calculator GUI

This grade calculator GUI was built using python and tkinter.
It allows users to add certain sections, such as exams, projects, labs, etc. The average of each section is updated along the way. The user also has the option to change the weights of different sections and update the grade scale. The calculate button updates the final grade and the section averages.
